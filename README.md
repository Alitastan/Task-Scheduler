# Task-Scheduler
Task scheduler example for the LEDs on NUCLEO-WB15CC board.

This example is based on FastBit Embedded Brain Academy course: Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 Processor (ARM Cortex M4 Processor specific) lecture #16.

In this Udemy course it was implemented using ARM Cortex M4 based STM32F407 DISCOVERY board from STM. I had NUCLEU-WB15CC while following this course. Please find my implementation on this repository. I hope it serves you well.
