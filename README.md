## *Task scheduler example for the LEDs on NUCLEO-WB15CC board.*

**This example is based on FastBit Embedded Brain Academy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-system-programming-on-arm-cortex-m3m4/) lecture #16.**

*In this Udemy course it was implemented using ARM Cortex M4 based STM32F407 DISCOVERY board from STM. I had NUCLEU-WB15CC while following this course. Please find my implementation on this repository. I hope it serves you well.*

*There is also a file called LEDexample which shows how to build the same code with custom startup and linkerscript files. Build options and all the flags are presented in the Makefile.*
